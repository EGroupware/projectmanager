Requirements:
-------------
* PHP 4.02 or higher
* GD 1.8.x, Experimental support for GD 2.x

CAVEAT 1: 
JpGraph is developed under Unix and is known to work well.
Please note that you may or may not encounter some known 
issues when trying to run on PHP/Apache/Windows or a 
combination of PHP/IIS. See below.

CAVEAT 2:
To get background images working with GD 2.0.1 you MUST enable
Truecolor images by setting the constant USE_TRUECOLOR to true. If you
don't fo this the background images will just be a black rectangle.
The bad thing with this is that the antialias for Truetypes is broken
using truecolor images in GD 2.0.1. This means you can't have 
background and TTF fonts in the same image.

Installation
------------
0. Make sure your PHP is AT LEAST 4.02 (preferrable 4.1.1) 
   and that you have compiled
   support for GD library. You must make aboslutely sure that you
   have GD working. Please run phpinfo() to check if GD library
   is supported in your installation. Please not that JpGraph only
   fully supports GD 1.x. There are known issues with GD 2.0.1.
   
1. Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice.

2. Set up the directory paths in jpgraph_dir.php where the cache directory
   should be and where your TTF directory is. Note that Apache/PHP must
   have write permission in your cache directory. 

   Caveat: On windows there seems to be some problem with including
   this file and you might have to move all the defines directly into
   jpgraph.php. If you get an error saying "Font not found" and you
   have specified the correct font path try the above mentioned
   workaround.  (See also paragraph 5 below)
   
4. Check that all rest of the DEFINE in the top of JpGraph.php 
   is setup to your preference. The default should be fine
   for most users. (See also Note 5. below)
   
3. Make sure PHP have write privileges to your cache directory.

4. Some windows installations seems to have a problem with a PHP
   script ending in a newline (This newline seems to be sent to the
   browser and will cause a Header already sent error). 
   If you have this problem try remove all trailing newlines in the
   jpgraph* files 

5. It has been reported that PHP 4.06 under IIS has problem correctly
   interpreting file paths. This can be solved by hardcoding the
   CACHE_DIRECTORY and FONT_DIRECTORY const ants directly in the code
   instead of using the defined constants. 

6. Read the FAQ on http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpg_faq.php.

Troubleshooting
---------------
1. Any PHP errors about function "imagecreate" does not exist indicates that
   your PHP installation does not include the GD library. This must be present.

2. Any error about "parent::" undefined means that you are not using PHP 4.02 or
   above. You _NEED_ PHP 4.02 or higher. This problem has also been
   reported to sometimes occur under Windows. This problem has also
   been reported by people running Zend-cache and is a bug in Zend. A
   workaround is to move all files into one single file.

3. If you don't get any background images (but rather a black
   background) you are most likely using GD 2.x which
   is not yet supported. JpGraph has only been verified with GD 1.x

4. If you are running PHP 4.06 and get an error saying "GD was not
   built with truetype support" you should know that this is a known
   problem with GD+PHP 4.06. There are some workarounds (search the
   net!) but it is really recommended that you instead upgrade to at least
   PHP 4.1.1 and configure PHP with --with-gd-native-ttf 
   (Please also note that the built in TTF uses point size for fonts
   whereas Truetype 2 uses pixels.)
   Please DON't ask me how to resolve the GD Font problem. All mail
   regarding this will go straight to /dev/null. Upgrade to 4.1.1!

5. If you are running IIS and Win2k and get the error "Can't find
   font' when trying to use TTF fonts then try to change you paths
   to UNIX style, i.e. "/usr/local/fonts/ttf/". Remember that the
   path is absolute and not relative to the htdocs catalogue.

6. If you are using the cache please make sure that you have
   set the permissions correctly for the cache directory so that
   Apache/PHP can write to that directory.
